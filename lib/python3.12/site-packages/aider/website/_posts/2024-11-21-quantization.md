# Details matter with open source models
{: .no_toc }

Open source models like Qwen 2.5 32B Instruct are performing very well on
aider's code editing benchmark, rivaling closed source frontier models.

But pay attention to how your model is being served and quantized, 
as it can impact code editing skill.
Open source models are often available at a variety of quantizations,
and can be served with different token limits.
These details matter when working with code.

The graph and table below compares different versions of the Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B Instruct model,
served both locally and from a variety of cloud providers.

- The [HuggingFace BF16 weights](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) served via [glhf.chat](https://glhf.chat).
- [4bit and 8bit quants for mlx](https://t.co/cwX3DYX35D).
- The results from [OpenRouter's mix of providers](https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct/providers) which serve the model with different levels of quantization.
- Results from individual providers served via OpenRouter and directly to their own APIs.
- Ollama locally serving different quantizations from the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-q4_K_M).

The best versions of the model rival GPT-4o, while the worst performer
is more like the older GPT-4 Turbo.
Suboptimal choices in quantization and token limits can
easily produce far worse results.

This benchmarking effort highlighted a number of pitfalls and details which
can have a significant impact on the model's ability to correctly edit code:

- Quantization -- Open source models are often available at dozens of different quantizations.
- Context window -- Cloud providers can decide how large a context window to accept,
and they often choose differently. Ollama defaults to a tiny 2k context window,
and silently discards data that exceeds it.
- Output token limits -- Open source models are often served with wildly
differing output token limits. This has a direct impact on how much code the
model can write or edit in a response.
- Buggy cloud providers -- Between Qwen and DeepSeep, there were
multiple cloud providers with broken or buggy API endpoints that seemed
to be returning result different from expected based on the advertised
quantization and context sizes.

## Setting Ollama's context window size

[Ollama uses a 2k context window by default](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-specify-the-context-window-size),
which is very small for working with aider.
Unlike most other LLM servers, Ollama does not throw an error if you submit
a request that exceeds the context window.
Instead, it just silently truncates the request by discarding the "oldest" messages
in the chat to make it fit within the context window.

All of the Ollama results above were collected with at least an 8k context window, which
is large enough to attempt all the coding problems in the benchmark.
Aider sets Ollama's context window to 8k by default.

You can change the Ollama server's context window with a 
[`.aider.model.settings.yml` file](https://aider.chat/docs/config/adv-model-settings.html#model-settings)
like this:

```
- name: ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16
  extra_params:
    num_ctx: 8192
```

## Choosing providers with OpenRouter

OpenRouter allows you to ignore specific providers in your
[preferences](https://openrouter.ai/settings/preferences).
This can be used to limit your OpenRouter requests to be
served by only your preferred providers.

## Notes

This article went through many revisions as I received feedback from
numerous members of the community.
Here are some of the noteworthy learnings and changes:

- The first version of this article included incorrect Ollama models.
- Earlier Ollama results used the too small default 2k context window,
artificially harming the benchmark results.
- The benchmark results appear to have uncovered a problem in the way
OpenRouter was communicating with Hyperbolic.
They fixed the issue 11/24/24, shortly after it was pointed out.
